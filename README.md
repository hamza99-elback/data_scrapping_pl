# data_scrapping_pl_google_big_query
 
In this project, I have implemented a straightforward ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. I used Python, along with the Selenium library, to scrape data from the Premier League website. After extracting the data, I performed various transformations using Pandas and NumPy. Finally, I loaded the transformed data into a Google BigQuery database.

For the next version of this project, I plan to enhance the ETL pipeline by utilizing Apache Airflow and the BigQueryOperator to automate and streamline the data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
